description:  Coming from cancer research with focus on high throughput screening for drug development in the early years of my bachelor, I got fascinated during an internship with functional assays such as field recordings to study neuronal cell behaviour. I got hooked on doing my master in bio-photonics to learn functional imaging. During my PhD I combined functional assays, super-resolution imaging and computational tools to quantitatively assess and explore synaptic protein organization and remodeling due to synaptic plasticity. Being a scientist for me is not a job, but a lifestyle in which I can be continuously curious and explore across fields, be it from neuroscience, photonics to machine learning. In another life, I would be a diplomat who writes fiction books on the side.
